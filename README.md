# Financial_Market_Data

Without professional financial data provider, fethcing financial data, either historical ones or real time ones would be technically difficult. The difficulty arises when user needs to find API key to access public data or private data, or, when such option is not available, one has to download the data and process locally.

To create a most commonly used financial data aggregation, this repo will present the following resources, at least showing effort to put as many as resources available for users to get various types of financial data.

Financial data in this repo will be categorized in progressive stages in the future, but mainly it would include, public pricing data(eg, euribor), macro economic data(eg, GDP), and many more. It could be useful to users to implement further analysis on such data.

The priority of this repo would be building links to:
1. Public free API without local processing of data(eg, euribor ECB data)
2. Public free API requiring registration and a key(eg, FRED)
3. Public data with option to download to local
